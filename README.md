# FlipLite
*Just so you know, this project was helped by AI coding, rough estimate, 40% is coded by me and the rest is coded via various coding LLMs.*

A browser-based, frame-by-frame animation tool inspired by Flipnote. It runs entirely locally in your browser with no accounts, no cloud saving, and no setup.

**[Launch FlipLite](https://fliplite.art)**

### Features

* **Canvas:** Max 500×400 resolution, can be changed in the settings.
* **Workflow:** 2 drawing layers, 1 background layer, and onion skinning.
* **Tools:** Dither brush, dither fill, shapes, text, selection/transform, motion path tool and mirror modes.
* **Timing:** Fixed FPS or variable per-frame timing.
* **Export:** Save as GIF or per-frame PNG sequences.
* **Storage:** Save projects locally as `.flip` files.

### Roadmap

* **Pixel Smudge Tool:** For blending and dragging pixels.
* **Plugin System:** A section for coding and integrating your own custom drawing tools.

### Compatibility

Desktop only. Recommended for **Firefox** or **Chrome**. I am working on a mobile build at a later time.
