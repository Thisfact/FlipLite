# FlipLite
*Just so you know, this project was helped by AI coding, rough estimate, 40% is coded by me and the rest is coded via various coding LLMs.*

A browser-based, frame-by-frame animation tool inspired by Flipnote. It runs entirely locally in your browser with no accounts, no cloud saving, and no setup.

**[Launch FlipLite](https://fliplite.art)**

### Features

* **Workflow:** 2 drawing layers, 1 background layer, and onion skinning.

* **Timing:** Fixed FPS or variable per-frame timing.

### Roadmap
