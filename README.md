# FlipLite
FlipLite is a browser-based animation tool inspired by Flipnote. It keeps things simple with a fixed canvas, local saving, and zero cloud bloat. I am actively adding features like a pixel smudge tool and a plugin section for coding your own drawing tools. Works best on desktop Firefox or Chrome.
